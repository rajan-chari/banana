# Briefing
Last updated: 2026-04-08 07:07

## Current Focus
pty-win/emcom UI coordinator (assigned by Rajan 2026-03-31). Owns spec→delegate→test→report loop with moss. Rajan handles strategic work; milo handles tactical pty-win/emcom iteration.

## Don't Forget
- Run `/rc-save` after each user request
- Use `git commit -F - <<'EOF'` heredoc pattern (not `$()` substitution)
- Chrome DevTools: use port 3601 (milo's session), NOT 3600 (Rajan's)
- emcom identity fallback: `emcom --identity c:/s/projects/work/teams/working/banana/identity.json <cmd>`
- ONNX output_probability is dict-keyed (not index): `result['output_probability'].data[0]['busy']`
- Layered auto-save: commit after completing each tracker item

- 2026-04-04 05:11 — Hook error fixed: endpoints returned {status:'ok'} failing Zod validation. Fix: return {}. type:http confirmed not feature-gated.
- 2026-04-04 01:35 — Tracker panel spec parked (moss on tests). Work tracker CLI live (tracker command in PATH).
- 2026-04-04 00:28 — Hook-based idle detection implemented (Stop, Notification, UserPromptSubmit). Needs server restart.

## Next Up
- Server restart needed by Rajan: hook-based idle detection (priority), cost regex, merged dashboard, pane separation, drag-and-drop, cost in checkpoints, last-active column, double-Ctrl+C fix. Large TS backlog.
- Tracker panel complete (2 rounds). Milo now implementing frontend directly (Rajan approved). Moss on test coverage.
- Frost's tracker WS endpoint ready but emcom-server.exe needs rebuild. Frontend WS subscription not yet wired (polling works).
- **fellow-agents E2E test COMPLETE (both platforms)**. Both VMs deallocated. setup.sh and setup.ps1 work end-to-end: binaries download from GitHub Release, emcom-server starts, agents register, pty-win serves UI in browser.

**E2E Findings — Fixes pushed to fellow-agents:**
1. setup.sh not executable → fixed (0420a53)
2. Claude Code hard requirement → now optional warning on both scripts (ed5ed9c, efe730b)
3. npm link needs sudo on Linux → fixed (d8731d4)
4. setup.ps1 PS 5.1 parse error → nested hashtable replaced with JSON here-string (fc06605). Still needs pwsh 7 — PS 5.1 can't handle the JSON here-string either. **Action: document pwsh 7 as prerequisite or fix PS 5.1 compat.**

**E2E Findings — Open bugs for moss/frost:**
5. pty-win shell button hardcodes "pwsh" → can't open terminal on Linux (moss notified)
6. Default folder root is C:\ even when --root is set → cosmetic but confusing
7. setup.ps1 pty-win launch via npm link doesn't work → manual `node dist\index.js` works. Start-Process in setup.ps1 may need fixing.
8. Health check URL `/api/health` returns 401 (requires auth) → health check silently fails

**Infra findings (not fellow-agents bugs):**
9. Snap browsers (Firefox, Chromium) broken in xrdp → use Google Chrome .deb
10. xrdp on Ubuntu 24.04 needs: TLS key chmod, dbus-x11 pkg, startwm.sh → xfce4-session, high-DPI scaling hacks
- Bolt subagent architecture validated (jade confirmed inheritance). Waiting for scout's pattern to ship first.
- Server restart backlog: hook-based idle detection, injection timestamps, cost history sampling, many TS changes.
- Detach/reattach ideated but not confirmed.
