# Briefing

Last updated: 2026-03-25 15:10

## Current Focus

Adopting briefing.md spec per Rajan's finalized design. Replacing session-context.md with this file.

## Don't Forget

- Stop emcom-server before rebuilding exe (Windows file lock)
- Check if pty-win force-idle context menu (commit `8f0340c`) covers Rajan's "force not busy" request — if yes, mark done in tracker
