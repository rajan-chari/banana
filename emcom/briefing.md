# Briefing

Last updated: 2026-03-25 19:00

## Current Focus

Idle — responded to team operating manual RFC with emcom-specific feedback. Offered to draft emcom/communication section. Waiting for Rajan's next steps.

## Don't Forget

- Stop emcom-server before rebuilding exe (Windows file lock)
- Check if pty-win force-idle context menu (commit `8f0340c`) covers Rajan's "force not busy" request — if yes, mark done in tracker
