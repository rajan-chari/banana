Domain knowledge and lessons learned for pty-win.

## Lessons Learned

### 2026-03-22: xterm.js open() can only be called once
xterm.js `term.open(element)` binds the terminal to a DOM element permanently. On workspace re-renders, create a persistent wrapper div on first open, then move it to the new container with `appendChild()`. Never call `open()` twice.

### 2026-03-22: body needs width: 100% for flexbox layout
Without `width: 100%` on `html, body`, the flexbox body shrink-wraps to content width instead of filling the viewport. This caused terminals to appear as narrow columns (~35% width). The fix is a single CSS line.

### 2026-03-22: fitAddon.fit() must sync resize to server
`term.onResize` doesn't always fire when `fit()` changes dimensions (e.g., if the terminal was already at those dims from a previous open). Always explicitly send a resize WebSocket message after every `fit()` call via a `fitAndSync()` helper.

### 2026-03-22: Dead sessions must be cleaned up on server
When a session dies (Claude exits), the server keeps it as "dead". If the user tries to reopen the same folder, the server returns 409 (name conflict). Fix: `autoRemoveDeadSession()` must DELETE from server, and `openFolder()` must clean up dead sessions before creating new ones.

### 2026-03-22: Workspace persistence requires re-render on WS connect
Workspaces are saved to localStorage, but terminals aren't. After page reload, the workspace layout is restored but terminals need the `sessions` WebSocket message to arrive before they can render. The `sessions` handler must call `renderActiveWorkspace()` (not just dashboard).

### 2026-03-22: Prune orphaned workspace leaves on session list update
If a session dies between page loads (server restarted), the workspace layout may reference sessions that no longer exist. When the `sessions` WS message arrives, compare leaf names against server session list and remove orphans via `buildBalancedTree()`.

### 2026-03-22: Double-click rename needs delayed single-click
Tab single-click switches workspace (calls `renderTabs()` which destroys DOM). Double-click to rename can't fire because the DOM element is gone after the first click. Fix: delay single-click by 250ms, cancel it if double-click fires within that window.

### 2026-03-22: Initial PTY dimensions should match browser
Server spawns PTY at 120x40 by default. Browser terminal may be 200x45. The mismatch causes Claude to render at 120 cols, leaving empty space. Fix: pass `cols`/`rows` in `POST /api/sessions` estimated from the workspace area dimensions.

### 2026-03-22: pty-win is npm-linked globally
`npm link` was run in the project directory, creating global shims in `AppData/Roaming/npm/`. The `pty-win` command is available from any directory. Since it's a symlink, `npm run build` updates it automatically — no re-linking needed. To run: `pty-win`, `pty-win --port 3602 --root "C:\some\project"`.

### 2026-03-22: Paired sessions (Claude + PowerShell) use pane groups
A folder can have both a Claude session (`myproject`) and a PowerShell session (`myproject~pwsh`). The tiling tree leaf still references the group name (bare folder basename). `state.paneGroups` maps group → `{claude?, pwsh?, activeType}` and is rebuilt from the session list on every WS `sessions` message. The pane header shows toggle buttons (`C` / `>_`) only when both session types exist. Key invariant: `killSession` and `autoRemoveDeadSession` must check for a living sibling before removing the tiling leaf — only remove when the entire group is dead.

### 2026-03-22: Sidebar folder matching must use full paths, not basenames
`refreshTreeRunningState()` matched folders to sessions by `nameEl.textContent` (basename only). This caused every folder sharing a name with an active session — across all roots — to flash green. The basename-match approach also races with async tree rendering (nodes load progressively from `/api/folders`). Fix: removed green folder-name feature entirely; rely on dot indicators only. Unread dots now use `normPath()` for path-aware matching.

### 2026-03-22: Dynamic emcom attach — watch for identity.json
If a Claude session starts before `emcom register` runs, there's no `identity.json` yet so no emcom poller is created. Fix: `PtySession.watchForIdentity()` polls every 5s for `identity.json` to appear, then calls `attachEmcom()` to create and start the poller dynamically. One limitation: `--append-system-prompt` (EMCOM_PREAMBLE) can't be injected retroactively — it's baked into Claude's launch args. Sessions that gain emcom mid-flight won't have the anti-double-polling instruction.
