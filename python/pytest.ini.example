# Alternative pytest configuration (without coverage)
#
# The main configuration is in pyproject.toml which includes coverage by default.
#
# To use this configuration instead (for running tests WITHOUT coverage):
# 1. Rename this file to pytest.ini (remove .example)
# 2. Run pytest (it will use this file instead of pyproject.toml)
# 3. To restore: rename back to pytest.ini.example
#
# OR simply run: pytest --no-cov (easier, keeps pyproject.toml active)
